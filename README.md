### Nearsoft Apprentice Yeoman Generator

Yeoman generator for setting up a TDD environment for the weekly Nearsoft's Apprentice. 

##Installing Yeoman

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-nearsoft-apprentice from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-nearsoft-apprentice
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo nearsoft-apprentice
```
